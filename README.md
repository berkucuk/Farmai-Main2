# Farm-AI

With the increasing world population in recent years, the need for food is also increasing. All the world's the nutritional requirement, which is the basic need, has increased and has become unmet due to the wrong techniques applied in agricultural areas.

Crop growers suffer losses by planting without knowing which crops their land is suitable for, and people who do not know about diseased plants continue to suffer because they cannot prevent this situation early.

At this point, soil classification and plant disease detection it will prevent the food shortage, which is predicted to be approaching, by increasing the efficiency in its applications. In our application, we developed a model in which we can detect both soil type and plant disease with Artificial Intelligence. As a result of our developments, we can see the soil type by analyzing the soil from the soil photo and provide a suitable crop recommendation. 

We aim to make the process more efficient by detecting diseases from our planted crop leaf pool and making improvement suggestions.
